# BatHat.js is a framework for an easy and fun development of a REST API. #

It has express (and, of course, NodeJS) for the HTTP Server, and MongoDB
as the database.


As the project grows, more documentation and tutorials will be added.

## This is an example-app using the BatHat framework. The contents for the real
module will be added after some progress  ##
