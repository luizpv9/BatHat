## BatHat.js is a framework for ~easy and fun~ development of Web Apps.

It has express (and, of course, Node.js) for the HTTP Server, and MongoDB
for the database.


As the project grows, more documentation and examples will be added.

> This is an example-app using the BatHat framework. The contents for the real module will be added after some progress
